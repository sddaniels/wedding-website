Wedding Website
===============

This is the website I created to share information about my wedding and take RSVPs. I
decided to use this project as an opportunity to learn a couple new things: Node.js,
MongoDB, Heroku, and Zurb Foundation. I'm also using a couple other frameworks from
npm like ExpressJs and Handlebars(hbs).
