Wedding Website
===============

This is the website I made in order to share information about my 
wedding and take RSVPs. I decided to use this project as an opportunity to learn a couple
new things: Node.js, MongoDB, Heroku, and Zurb Foundation. I'm also using a couple other
frameworks from npm like ExpressJs and Handlebars(hbs).
